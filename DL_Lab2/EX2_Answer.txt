Q1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes is increased?

With too few nodes (1–2), the model underfits → very simple boundary, low accuracy.

With more nodes (5, 20, 50), the model fits more complex shapes → accuracy goes up.

Very large hidden layers may cause overfitting or unstable results.



Q2. What can you say about the accuracy pattern?

Accuracy usually increases as hidden units increase, but not strictly linearly.

After some point, gains are small (diminishing returns).

Sometimes accuracy fluctuates because of initialization, learning rate, or overfitting.
